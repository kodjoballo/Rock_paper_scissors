### 🚀 Suggested Improvements

Fix case-sensitivity bug

Right now, "Rock" vs "rock" might cause mismatches. You can just use .lower() everywhere consistently.

Add replay stats

Show total games played & win percentage.

Best of N mode

Instead of indefinite rounds, add a "Best of 3" or "Best of 5" mode.

Smarter computer AI (optional upgrade)

Instead of random moves, you could make the computer “learn” from player patterns.
